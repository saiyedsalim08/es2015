1. What is the difference between var and let?
- let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, 
or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, 
or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

2. What is the difference between var and const?
- Variables declared with var are in the function scope. Variables declared as let are in the block scope. 
Variables declared as const are in the block scope.

3. What is the difference between let and const?
- The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. 
It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.

4. What is hoisting?
- Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.
